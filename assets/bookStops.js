			`STEVE BUSCEMI: Welcome to Eastern State Penitentiary. In a moment, we'll enter the cellblocks, but our tour begins here in this gravel covered area.
 			I'm actor and director, Steve Buscemi. I'll be one of your guides as you visit the prison. You'll also hear from former inmates, guards and the people who have studied and preserved this historic building. These are their real voices.`,
			`ANONYMOUS INMATE 5: I was scared to death. You didn't know what was going to happen.`,
			`RICHARD GRIFFIN, GUARD: Well, I used to tell 'em outright, you try to hurt me, I'm gonna try to kill you. Tit for tat, pal.`,
			`JESSE DIGUGLIELMO, INMATE: If you look at the walls outside, they were like 25, 30 feet in the air. But on the inside, they were like 60 or 70 feet in the air.`,
			`NORMAN JOHNSTON, SOCIOLOGIST: Eastern State is without a doubt the most influential prison that was ever built.`,
			`STEVE BUSCEMI: Before we enter the cellblocks, follow the road to the raised concrete surface facing the outside wall. I first came to Eastern State in 1999. I was scouting a film location, and was amazed to find this magnificent ruin-still standing in the middle of a modern city.
			You should now be on the raised concrete surface alongside the road. You're standing inside the world's first true penitentiary, a building designed to inspire penitence-or true regret-in the hearts of criminals. The architects here believed that all human beings, regardless of their behavior, have good in their hearts. They believed Eastern State Penitentiary would inspire a new generation of prisons, worldwide, built on this optimism and faith in the human character. On the inside, Eastern State was progressive, even visionary. But on the outside? This illustration shows Eastern State, on its isolated hilltop, a year after it opened. Look at the walls. They're 30-feet tall- with an additional 10 feet below ground level. Look at the battlements across the roofline, the towers. On the outside this building is a castle, a fortress, a dungeon.`,
			`ACTOR: "Let the avenue to this house be rendered difficult and gloomy by mountains and morasses. Let the doors be of iron; and let the grating occasioned by opening and shutting them extend a sound that shall deeply pierce the soul." Benjamin Rush, 1787`,
			`STEVE BUSCEMI: Standing isolated on a lonely hilltop, some mile and a half outside the early City of Philadelphia, this massive building was designed to dominate the landscape and imply a harsh physical threat to lawbreakers in the city below.
 			But the prison's Gothic Revival architecture is mostly for show. The battlements across the top of the administration building are fake- they're only ankle-high-and wouldn't provide much protection in battle. And you may have noticed tall arrow slit windows lining the front wall as you approached the prison today, the type of windows seen  in castles. Well, they're fake too. You're now looking at that huge wall from the inside, and you can see that those window frames don't penetrate this solid, featureless wall.`,
			`Step down from the raised concrete surface, and follow the roadway around the corner to the left. When you arrive at the entrance to Cellblock 1, in the courtyard under the corner guard tower, press 2 and the green play button on your Acoustiguide.`,

			`STEVE BUSCEMI: This is Cellblock 1. It opened in 1829. Step inside. Take your time, and look around. There is an illustration on your right. Before Eastern State, criminals were sent to places such as the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia, to await punishment. You can see all sorts of prisoners, men and women, adults and children, petty thieves and murderers, thrown into the jail together-and left to scheme or fight among themselves, in crowded, unheated rooms.
 			But as bad as these jails were, they were not designed to punish. They were simply holding pens for those waiting to receive their sentences. Flogging, whipping, public humiliation, heavy fines, public execution- these were the typical punishments of the 1700s. A group of prominent Americans were horrified by the conditions in the jails. They met, just after the American Revolution, in the home of Benjamin Franklin. They had a great 18th century name for their  organization: "The Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons" and they were the first prison reform group in the world. They believed convicts needed time alone-in silence, to rediscover their good nature. The early prison reformers saw solitary confinement, not as a punishment, but an as opportunity for reflection. A chance to become penitent. Our tour continues at the illustration of Eastern State in 1830, on the right-hand side of this corridor. When you're ready to continue your tour, press 3 and the green play button on your Acoustiguide.`,

		content: [
			`STEVE BUSCEMI: Who would design this massive structure? The State of Pennsylvania held a competition-and a one hundred-dollar prize was awarded to John Haviland, a young, British-trained architect. He was faced with a huge challenge: holding hundreds of prisoners in strict solitary confinement. Now that may sound simple today, but remember that in 1829, even the White House had no running water, and the president-Andrew Jackson-used a chamber pot. Even the wealthiest Americans heated their homes with wood or coal fireplaces. The model represents a cross section of this corridor as it stood in 1830. Notice that each prisoner here had his own cell-roughly 8 by 12 feet- with a bed, a workbench, and a cast-iron toilet that was flushed with water once a day. Architect David Cornelius has studied these buildings since 1983. He's even explored the utility tunnels that run beneath this corridor. `,
			`DAVID CORNELIUS: There were actually a few escapes through the sewer, but prisoners usually found easier ways of escaping. Try escaping through your toilet at home [laughs].`,
			`STEVE BUSCEMI: Now remember, when they were new, these cellblocks had a striking, church-like appearance. The cells had wooden floors and a high, arched ceiling almost like a chapel-with a round skylight, called the "dead eye." The back of each cell had a small door. It opened into a walled exercise yard, slightly larger than the cell itself, but open to the sky. Notice, on the model, that there is no door connecting the central corridor-where you're standing-to the cells. The doors you see now lining this corridor were added in the 1850s. Originally, there was just a small opening, called a feeding hole, through which meals could be passed to the inmates. Originally, the only way into these cells was through the exercise yard door. The cells were heated by a furnace located in a small shed at the end of the cellblock. You can see it at the very back of the model.
 			Haviland designed a prison system that would allow each prisoner to be kept completely isolated from his neighbor. Gone were the rowdy crowds of thieves and prostitutes. Gone, too, they hoped, were outbreaks of typhus-or, as it was known, Jail Fever. Again, architect David Cornelius.`,
			`DAVID CORNELIUS: Keep in mind that in the 1830s germs were basically unknown, people believed that illnesses were spread by bad air, which is not entirely true but not entirely false either. And Haviland had the challenge that if his  architecture didn't work, his users were going to die. It had to work. It was the 1830s equivalent of designing a spaceship, wherein all life support had to be provided successfully.`,
			`STEVE BUSCEMI: John Haviland had built the first truly modern building in the United States. But would it reform criminals? When you're ready to continueyour tour, press 4 and the green play button on your Acoustiguide.`,
